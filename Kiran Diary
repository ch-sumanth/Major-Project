Security System using OpenCV


Aug-03:
referring how security system help in real time problems and solving in a different way.

some of the IEEE documents and articles mention in below.

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/723792

https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/an-overview-to-computer-vision-thats-redefining-surveillance

searching for an detection model in image processing.

referring about a  various object detection and human detection.

https://towardsdatascience.com/object-detection-with-tensorflow-model-and-opencv-d839f3e42849

and finnaly comes with a haarcascade model.

What is Haarcascade?
A.Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier
We use haar cascade to identify faces in an image or real time video.
Accuracy of haar cascade is around 89%.

The main goal to select a haarcascade model is because it has already predefine model for detect human face and giving a accuracy around 80-95%.

so i want to take to use haarcascade model in my project.

reffering to "how an algorithm detect the human and what are the features it can extract to detect?"

    Detecting human beings accurately in a visual surveillance system is crucial for diverse application areas including abnormal event detection, human gait characterization,
   congestion analysis, person identification, gender classification and fall detection for elderly people. The first step of the detection process is to 
   detect an object which is in motion. Object detection could be performed using background subtraction, optical flow and spatio-temporal filtering techniques.
   
 i came to knew that with the help of serveillance system and harcascade model it will detect the human face 
 but here problem is when human face poster is pasted on the wall it will detect that also.
  so i need a another solution to solve this.

From above problem 
I want to implement a motion detection and human detection combined.

Referring for a motion detection

https://learn.adafruit.com/pir-passive-infrared-proximity-motion-sensor

From this above article i came to knew about that PIR sensor

what is pir sensor?
PIR sensors allow you to sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the sensors range. They are small, inexpensive, 
low-power, easy to use and don't wear out. For that reason they are commonly found in appliances and gadgets used in homes or businesses. 
They are often referred to as PIR, "Passive Infrared", "Pyroelectric", or "IR motion" sensors.

working of pir sensor?

The passive infrared sensor does not radiate energy to space. It receives the infrared radiation from the human body to make an alarm. Any object with temperature 
is constantly radiating infrared rays to the outside world

How to implement a hardware sensor with opencv?

Here i'm mention document link to shows how to connect with hardware sensor and  opencv.

searching for a platform to deploy opencv code and motion sensor

After referring all i came to knew that

visual studio express edition is best platform to implement my opencv code

https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/dd/d6e/tutorial_windows_visual_studio_opencv.html

I mention above link which i had refered to choose visual studio platform

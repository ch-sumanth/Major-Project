Security System using openCV
Aug-10:

I want to implement a motion detection and human detection combined.

Referring for a motion detection

https://learn.adafruit.com/pir-passive-infrared-proximity-motion-sensor

From this above article i came to knew about that PIR sensor

what is pir sensor?
PIR sensors allow you to sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the sensors range. They are small, inexpensive, 
low-power, easy to use and don't wear out. For that reason they are commonly found in appliances and gadgets used in homes or businesses. 
They are often referred to as PIR, "Passive Infrared", "Pyroelectric", or "IR motion" sensors.

working of pir sensor?

The passive infrared sensor does not radiate energy to space. It receives the infrared radiation from the human body to make an alarm. Any object with temperature 
is constantly radiating infrared rays to the outside world

How to implement a hardware sensor with opencv?

Here i'm mention document link to shows how to connect with hardware sensor and  opencv.

working on arduino and arduino ide

implementing code on arduino ide

checking errors and able to finding solution for that

connecting wires of sensors and defining outputs

finding accuracy of result
